!Series_summary	"To get insight the molecular mechanism underlying neuronal loss in Parkinson´s disease.  We  performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of midbrain of mice injected with an AAV control or an AAV expressing human tyrosinase that induces neuromelanin accumulation and subsequent neuronal loss."
